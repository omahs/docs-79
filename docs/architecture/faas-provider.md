# `faas-provider` Interface

The `faas-provider` provides the CRUD API for Functions as well as the invoke capabilities.

The [`faas-provider`](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-provider) is an SDK written in Go which conforms to the OpenFaaS Provider's HTTP REST API. Providers which implement the interface should be compatible with the OpenFaaS toolchain and ecosystem, including the UI, CLI, Function Store and Template Store.

Each provider implements the following behaviours:

* CRUD for Functions (or microservices)
* Invocation of Functions via a proxy
* Scaling of Functions
* CRUD for Secrets (optional)
* Log streaming (optional)
